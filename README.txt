Created a web app, the Movie Recommendation System! üçøüé•

Built with Machine Learning and deployed using Flask, this innovative application provides personalized movie recommendations based on your preferences. Seamlessly designed with HTML and CSS, the user interface ensures a visually appealing and intuitive experience.

With a user-friendly interface, my application allows users to input their favorite movies and discover similar films, enabling them to explore a curated selection that aligns with their unique taste.

Furthermore, I plan to expand the movie database by integrating with external APIs and incorporating user feedback to ensure a wider range of movie options and an ever-growing collection.
